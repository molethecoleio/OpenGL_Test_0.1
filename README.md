added GLSL(OpenGL Shading Language) functionality;
all my libarys and GLSL files are in my reposity; my libarys are in a file called Dirs for some reason lol;
but yeah all that has really changed is some error checking for my shaders and me drawing a triangle; I think im done coding for this morning;
Thanks a bunch whoever is reading this, stay safe and have a good one :D
